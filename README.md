# FundMe Dapp

This is a minimal dapp which implements the [FundMe Smart Contract](https://github.com/0xSanyam/Funding-Contract-HH).

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repo

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/0xSanyam/FundMe-Dapp
   ```

2. Run the file

   You can usually just double click the file to "run it in the browser". Or you can right click the file in your VSCode and run "open with live server".

## Implementation

When opened in a browser having metamask wallet extension, it looks like this

And if you open in a browser, which doesn't have the metamask extension, then it looks like this

![No Metamask](/assets/No%20Metamask.png)

![NA](/assets/NA.png)

It prompts us with a button stating "Please install Metamask", when clicking on it, it leads us to the offical download page

When connected it shows us the chain id and the network id and ðŸ›‘ warns us if we are on the ethereum mainnet

If we click on the Account button(metamask connected), it shows us our current account number

Now, comes the withdrawal part, first we will like to see the current balance after several more transactions in this smart contract, then we'll do the withdrawal

Current balance is 999.05 Eth and the total available credit in our account is
